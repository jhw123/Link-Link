# Link-Link

Link-Link is a block-matching puzzle game which a player earns scores by moving around falling blocks to link blocks with a same color. Blocks are removed when they are linked, and a player keeps playing until the screen is full of unlinked blocks. The basic design of Link-Link is greatly inspired by [Tetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris) and other block-matching games.

## Design Considerations

I considered three design aspects while developing Link-Link. The aspects are:

1. Simplicity
	-	I would like to make games that are easy to learn and play. I tried making the interaction and rule easy so that even my parents can play. 

2. Expandability
	-	I think good games should be able to expand by themselves. Although pre-defined stages in many of puzzle games gaurantee entertainment, I think the pre-defined nature makes games loose in a long run. Link-Link is designed to, hopefully, entertain players indefintely.

3. Complexity
	-	Puzzle games should be simple, but challengingâ€“"easy to learn, hard to master." I found that Link-Link becomes extremely difficult as the number of block colors increases. It was hard for me to balance the difficulty of Link-Link smoothly over a whole gameplay.
